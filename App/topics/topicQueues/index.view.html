				<h5 class="topic-sub-title mt-0 mb-1">What are they?</h5>
				Queues are very similar to stacks. They have the same linear structure, they also support pop and push,
				but instead of being “Last in, First out”, queues are “First in, First out” (FIFO). An easy way to visualize this is to think of a line waiting for food.

				<h5 class="topic-sub-title mt-0 mb-1">How do they work?</h5>
				When someone new joins the line, they have to wait at the back. When someone leaves the line, it’s because they got their food and can leave now.
				So, the first person who enters the line will be the quickest to leave the line. Again, this push / pop mechanism is useful for different types of algorithms.

				This push / pop mechanism is useful for different types of algorithms, although we won’t go into it here. Understanding how it works is the most important part.
