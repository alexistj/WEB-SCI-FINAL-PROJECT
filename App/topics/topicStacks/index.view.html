				A stack is another linear data structure, one that supports two basic functions, pop and push.

				Pop removes an element, while push adds one. Stacks follow a “Last in, First out” (LIFO) structure. An easy way to visualize this is to think of the stack as a stack of pancakes.
				When you add a new element, it’s as if you’re adding a pancake to the top of the stack. When you remove an element, you take it off the top, not the bottom. So, the last pancake that you add to the stack will be the first one removed, and the first pancake that gets added to the
				stack is the last one off the plate. Similarly, the last element that you push to the stack will be the first one popped off the stack.

				This push / pop mechanism is useful for different types of algorithms, although we won’t go into it here. Understanding how it works is the most important part.
