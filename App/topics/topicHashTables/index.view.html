				Hash tables are one of the best data structures that exist, as they can perform many functions extremely quickly. Hash tables work by having a
				key-value binding. Similarly to how arrays and linked lists have a key-value binding (the index 0-length is the key, value is the element),
				hash tables have one too, but the keys don’t need to be between 0 and the size of the structure. In fact, they don’t even have to be integers.

				<h5 class="topic-sub-title mt-0 mb-1">How do they work?</h5>
				The way it works is that the hash table comes with what’s called a hashing algorithm.
				It’s a complex mathematical equation that turns the key into a number, which indicates where the element is located.
				So, let’s say we have the string “hi” as a key. An extremely basic (and not very good) hashing algorithm could work by taking the
				index of the letters and adding them up, so “hi” would translate to 8+9=17. The hash table would then look in the 17th index, and the value would be there.

				So, what if the hashing algorithm returns the same value? Using the example algorithm, “hi” and “eeea” would have the same result.
				In this case, you’d have a list at each element, and the list would hold all the key-value pairs there, so at the 17th index would be
				“hi” and its value as well as “eeea” and its value. You would then run through that list until you found your key. Still pretty fast, but
				a good hashing algorithm will minimize how often this needs to happen.

				<h5 class="topic-sub-title mt-0 mb-1">Why and When to use them?</h5>
				So, hash tables are even faster than binary search trees for searching, and for adding / deleting elements.
				This is because the hashing algorithm is constant time, meaning it doesn’t take longer as the size of the table grows.
				Also, making your own custom hashing algorithm is usually not a good idea, since there are many established and very
				good hashing algorithms that you should use instead.
