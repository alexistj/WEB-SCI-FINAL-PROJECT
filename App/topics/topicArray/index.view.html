			Arrays are quite possibly the most basic data structure available. You can think of
			an array as a large box with many subsections, and each section has some sort of data within it.
			This is a representation of how an array will look to the computer:

			There are a couple
		 of important things to note about this structure. First of all, all of the elements inside
		 the array are next to each other. Second, the first element in the array is denoted as array[0].
		 Almost every language will start off the first index at zero. Finally, all the elements in the
		 array need to be the same data type (in C++). So, you canâ€™t have array[0] be an integer and array[1] be a string.
		 So, why use arrays? Well, accessing an element in the array is super fast, since every element
		 has a number attached to it, so it takes the computer almost no time to access it.
		 Having that number attached to all elements also maintains order in the array. Also,
		 the simplicity of these structures keeps everything at a set length, which can be
		 helpful. However, being a set length also comes with some drawbacks.
		 Adding new elements requires the computer to copy the current array into a new,
		 bigger array, which can take a while especially if the array is particularly big.
		 The same logic applies for removing elements as well.
