# StartDS

StartDS is a web application to aid in the transitioning of RPI students from Computer Science 1 to Data Structures.

We intend to accomplish this through interactive learning exercises, games, and code challenges that can be completed through our built in compiler.

To run our application:

1. Clone the repositiory
2. Install the necessary modules by using 'npm install'
    - If you do not have node or npm installed please visit https://nodejs.org/en/, and download accordingly
3. Set environment variables for the database within mongo atlus.
    - To make an account: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
4. Then run the server by using nodemon app.js or node app.js
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/App/#/ in your browser to get started!
